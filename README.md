<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Addie Garner! I have two wonderful parents as well as two beautiful, older sisters. I was raised in the small town of Jasper, GA. However, I currently live in Athens, GA and love the college town atmosphere. I am a Sophomore (almost a Junior) at the University of Georgia. I am working on my degree in Fashion Merchandising. As I have always been a lover of fashion, my career path was a no brainer.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>
<p>I began my college career at Dalton State University in Fall 2015. In April of 2016, I applied to the University of Georgia. Within four weeks, I was notified that I would beign classes at the university in Spring 2017. I decided to enroll at the University of North Georgia Oconee Campus for the Fall semester of 2016 to ensure a living situation. Happily, I became a bulldog in January!</p>

<h4>Career Goals</h4>
<p>I have dreamed of making a career out of fashion ever since I was a little girl. As long as I can remember, it is the only career option I have been passionate about. I personally feel that style is a form of self-expression. I was granted the opportunity to model and market clothing for a boutique in my hometown. Not only did I enjoy playing dress up, but this job made me fall even more in love with my desired field of study. As I grew older, it was time to consider colleges. I was estatic to learn that the University of Georgia offered Fashion Merchandising as a major. I knew I would ultimately end up here in Athens, Georgia. This Summer I will jumpstart my major classes with the Fundamentals of Fashion Merchandising course. Before long, I will be applying for interships. My goal is to work under the wings of my faviorite company within the industry, Lilly Pulitzer. Not only do I love to wear her designs, but they are also playful and vibrant acting as a year-long reminder of summertime and vacation.</p>
